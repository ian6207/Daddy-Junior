      <h1>Daddy is a nice big mac person. His cooking is too tasty that if other chefs try to cook his food they'll be destroyed because they're too weak. Besides a good cook, he is very nice. When his belly is yet not satisfied after three hundred thousand plates he still gives them to Mommy and and his family.</h1>
